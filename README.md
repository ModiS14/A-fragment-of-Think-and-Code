# A-fragment-of-Think-and-Code
This is a collection of certain small (but interesting, hopefully) projects. They might be inspired by books, movies, and real-life experience. The philosophy is to do research and write code to test ideas and show empirical evidence.
## Yi Jing (or I-Ching) A Chinese Fortune-telling Technique《周易》揲蓍法  
I deliberately sacrifice some extent of simplicity to elaborate the technique. After all, the algorithm is not hard-to-understand. However, the creators of this technique (it is said to be Fu Xi 伏羲 and Ji Chang 周文王姬昌, but was interpreted by Zhu Xi 朱熹), make use of meaningful numbers such as 55 (the sum of one to ten 大衍之数 the number of expansion), therefore, I would like to include these numbers in the code.
